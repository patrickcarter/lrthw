I used 4.0 for space_in_a_car, 
but is that necessary? 
What happens if it's just 4? It changes the outcome of the number of people to carry from 120.0 t0 just 120

Remember that 4.0 is a floating point number. 
It's just a number with a decimal point, 
and you need 4.0 instead of just 4 so that it is floating point.
Write comments above each of the variable assignments.

Make sure you know what = is called (equals) and that it's making names for things.
Remember that _ is an underscore character.
Try running ruby from the Terminal as a calculator 
like you did before and use variable names to do your calculations. 
Popular variable names are also i, x, and j.
