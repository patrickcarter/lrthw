> Remember in Exercise 0 when you started Ruby? 
Start Ruby this way again and using the math operators, use Ruby as a calculator.
Find something you need to calculate and write a new .rb file that does it.
Notice the math seems "wrong"? There are no fractions, only whole numbers. You need to use a "floating point" number, which is a number with a decimal point, as in 10.5, or 0.89, or even 3.0.
Rewrite ex3.rb to use floating point numbers so it's more accurate. 20.0 is floating point.
